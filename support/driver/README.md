# Drivers support

Low level drivers that dependant of the processor.

Each driver must have a particular directory with the same name of the driver which contains a 'driver-name'.mk file.

## How to add a driver support?
Create a directory with the name of the driver in this directory :

	mkdir <driver-name>

Add <driver-name>.mk in this directory. This file will be included by the makefile when a project ask the support for this driver.

To avoid multiple inclusion of <driver-name>.mk, add this (example with timer) :

```Makefile
	ifndef TIMER_DRIVER
	TIMER_DRIVER=
	
	#content of file here ....
	
	endif
```

If the driver need the support of another drivers, add it :

```Makefile
	DRIVERS += another_driver
```

To include C files directory to paths of sources, add this directives and as many you need :

```Makefile
	vpath %.c $(DRIVERPATH)
	vpath %.h $(DRIVERPATH)
	vpath %.c $(DRIVERPATH)/other-source-dir
	vpath %.h $(DRIVERPATH)/other-source-dir
```

You just need to add header and source code files :

```Makefile
	SRC += timer.c
	HEADER += timer.h
```

And for specific architecture :

```Makefile
	ifeq ($(ARCHI),$(filter $(ARCHI),dspic33ep dspic33fj))
	 ARCHI_SRC += timer_dspic33.c
	 HEADER += timer_dspic33.h
	endif
	ifeq ($(ARCHI), pic24)
	 ARCHI_SRC += timer_pic24.c
	 HEADER += timer_pic24.h
	endif
```

To implement a simulator interface :

```Makefile
	SIM_SRC += timer_sim.c
```

And for global inclusion of the driver, add a header file that include needed include files of the support in include/driver/.
